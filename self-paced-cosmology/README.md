# Self paced cosmology

This repo will host some jupyter notebooks based on Peebles' Principles of Physical Cosmology (hereafter PoPC).

PoPC is fantastic book to read. However it is not a typical "textbook" and I am not a theoretician. In order to understand cosmology in its entirety, I have to work out problems or better, do some simulations. So, my plan is to gather the required data and perform some of the simple calculations and simulations given in PoPC. 

The notebooks given here are not foolproof, so you have been warned !
